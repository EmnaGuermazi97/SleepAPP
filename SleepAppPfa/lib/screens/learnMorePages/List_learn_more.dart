        'Reasearches have found that watching TV before bed may make a person chronically sleep-deprived, as it often prompts people to go against their biological sleep cues. For a more restful evening, turn off the TV a few hours before bed and enjoy some less-disruptive activities, like reading, instead. ',
        'Waking well-rested could be as simple as brewing yourself a cup of chamomile tea in the evening. In fact, they were studies that revealed that new mothers who added chamomile tea to their routine experienced fewer physical effects from sleep deprivation, including depression, than those who skipped the tea.',
        'Fish oil is great for your heart, but did you know that it is also pretty effective when it comes to your sleep habits, too?',
        'Before you pop a sleeping pill, try taking a few laps around the block first. Exercise is a great way to develop healthier sleep habits and get yourself physically tired enough to crawl into bed.',
        'If you are having trouble sleeping, it might be worth shifting your medication schedule. Everything from antidepressants to ADHD medications to OTC headache cures can interfere with your sleep, so if you are struggling to sleep, ask your doctor if taking your meds in the morning is an option.',
        'Ending the evening with a cigarette or vape might be the reason you are having such a hard time getting enough rest.To sleep better, skip the smokes before bed—or, better yet, try to quit them for good as soon as possible.',
        'Taking some time for yourself at the end of the day can make a major difference in how you sleep. Few studies  suggests that stress can significantly reduce sleep quality and quantity, so add some technology-free activities that help you relax, like reading or taking a bath, to your evening and you might just wake up well-rested for once.'

        'Unhealthy daytime habits and lifestyle choices can leave you tossing and turning at night and adversely affect your mood, brain and heart health, immune system, creativity, vitality, and weight. But by experimenting with the following tips, you can enjoy better sleep at night, boost your health, and improve how you think and feel during the day. ',
        ' This helps set your body’s internal clock and optimize the quality of your sleep. Choose a bed time when you normally feel tired, so that you don’t toss and turn. If you’re getting enough sleep, you should wake up naturally without an alarm. If you need an alarm clock, you may need an earlier bedtime.',
        'The more your weekend/weekday sleep schedules differ, the worse the jetlag-like symptoms you’ll experience. If you need to make up for a late night, opt for a daytime nap rather than sleeping in. This allows you to pay off your sleep debt without disturbing your natural sleep-wake rhythm.',
        'While napping is a good way to make up for lost sleep, if you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep at night, napping can make things worse. Limit naps to 15 to 20 minutes in the early afternoon.',
        ' If you get sleepy way before your bedtime, get off the couch and do something mildly stimulating, such as washing the dishes, calling a friend, or getting clothes ready for the next day. If you give in to the drowsiness, you may wake up later in the night and have trouble getting back to sleep.',
        ' The blue light emitted by your phone, tablet, computer, or TV is especially disruptive. You can minimize the impact by using devices with smaller screens, turning the brightness down, or using light-altering software '

        'There are two basic types of sleep:  rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep (which has three different stages).  Each is linked to specific brain waves and neuronal activity.  You cycle through all stages of non-REM and REM sleep several times during a typical night, with increasingly longer, deeper REM periods occurring toward morning. ',
        'non-REM sleep is the changeover from wakefulness to sleep.  During this short period (lasting several minutes) of relatively light sleep, your heartbeat, breathing, and eye movements slow, and your muscles relax with occasional twitches.  Your brain waves begin to slow from their daytime wakefulness patterns.',
        ' non-REM sleep is a period of light sleep before you enter deeper sleep.  Your heartbeat and breathing slow, and muscles relax even further.  Your body temperature drops and eye movements stop.  Brain wave activity slows but is marked by brief bursts of electrical activity.  You spend more of your repeated sleep cycles in stage 2 sleep than in other sleep stages.',
        'non-REM sleep is the period of deep sleep that you need to feel refreshed in the morning.  It occurs in longer periods during the first half of the night.  Your heartbeat and breathing slow to their lowest levels during sleep.  Your muscles are relaxed and it may be difficult to awaken you.  Brain waves become even slower.',
        ' first occurs about 90 minutes after falling asleep.  Your eyes move rapidly from side to side behind closed eyelids.  Mixed frequency brain wave activity becomes closer to that seen in wakefulness.  Your breathing becomes faster and irregular, and your heart rate and blood pressure increase to near waking levels.  Most of your dreaming occurs during REM sleep, although some can also occur in non-REM sleep.  Your arm and leg muscles become temporarily paralyzed, which prevents you from acting out your dreams.  As you age, you sleep less of your time in REM sleep.  Memory consolidation most likely requires both non-REM and REM sleep.'
